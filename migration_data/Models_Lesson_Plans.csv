1,"Guided Reading of Poetry","Guided Reading / Poetry Ideas

Here are some ideas that have proven successful...don't always do the same
thing. Make poems on charts and give each student their own copy.

* rhyming pattern & locate words that rhyme with _____.
* vocabulary study
* phonics ... vowel searches (short & long), blends, digraphs, dipthongs, contractions, suffixes, compound words, etc.
* spelling changes
* locating synonyms, antonyms, homonyms for other words
* word families
* illustrate poem to support poem
* write a response to the poem or several sentences related to the poem's topic & illustration
* use poems to introduce content areas
* echo read
* choral read
* partner read
* what do you notice (just ask kids this question & wow do they notice a lot!!)
* reflections ... write at least five sentences about what the relevance of the
* poem to the children, what it reminds them about or why they liked/disliked
* it.","Johnny Cash",1,"English"
2,"Literature Connection to the Six Traits of Writing","Find the secret to generating prewriting ideas. Provide opportunities for students to expand their imaginations by combining this tall tale of Harvey Potter's magical balloon farm! After reading the story of a strange but wonderful farmer, encourage students to imagine what secret steps they might take to grow colorful balloons from their prewriting IDEAS. 

Have students write their secrets on construction paper balloons and glue onto pipe cleaners. Encourage them to include listmaking,t-charts, mapping, or and other prewriting stategy that helps them manage and narrow their topics. Writing one of their magical topics on each balloon will motivate students to nurture and harvest it to a published writing piece. 

After they have completed several balloons, plant them into small clay pots with
Plaster of Paris. Plant extra pipe cleaners. Writers will want to contunue to
add to their balloon gardens as their imaginations grow.","Art

3,"Fraction Pizza","• Gain attention- “Today we will be working on a math lesson that deals with Pizza.”

• Inform learner of objectives-  “In our lesson for today we will be reviewing and learning more about fractions.”

• Stimulate recall of prior learning- Review equivalent fractions by example on the board
Review parts of a whole on the board

• Present stimulus material- Introduce Fraction Pizza software using computer and LCD projector

• Provide learner Guidance- Teacher demonstrates and works through Mozart and Tic Frac Toe portion of software

• Elicit performance- Divide students into partners for working together on the computer

• Provide feedback- Teacher monitors partners at the computer to provide encouragement and assistance as required

• Assess Performance- Check student scores on computer activity

• Enhance retention and transfer- Students will complete accompanying worksheets from the text
“How do you use fractions in your life? For tomorrow please come with an example
of how fractions are used in your home.”","Dolly Parton",3,"Math"
4,"Finding Common Denominators","Content
During this lesson, students will be exploring the concept of expressing two fractions, originating with different denominators, as two fractions sharing a common denominator. Students will be using their basic multiplication skills to produce these new denominators. It is important that students have prior knowledge of their basic facts as well as an understanding of the meaning behind terms such as “factors” and “common factors”.

Introduction
“How many of you have ever had pie for dessert at Thanksgiving dinner or for another occasion? Did you have the whole pie to yourself? More than likely you shared that pie with other hungry guests. Therefore, your slice of pie was a fraction of the whole pie.” 
“Lets say you shared that pie with 3 other people, meaning your piece was ¼ of the whole pie. Now, lets talk about my Thanksgiving pie experience. Imagine if I had the same sized pie, but instead of cutting my pie into fourths, mine was cut into eights, and instead of eating one piece, I ate two. Which one of us ate more pie? Lets demonstrate this situation using our manipulatives on the overhead projector.”

Methods/Procedures
Once the lesson is explained, I will break the students up into small groups (4-5 students) to practice finding common denominators of pairs of fractions. The students will be working in their groups to solve written problems, with help of manipulatives, as well as creating a document using the Inspiration software to map out which fractions are equivalent to each other. Students will be reminded to recall the common factors the two denominators share as a focus for solving their problems. 
Groups will be assigned to form based on heterogeneous skill levels. In this case, I believe it would be best to have higher-level students help out those who may need further explanation. While doing this, those higher-leveled students will be solidifying their knowledge of the content while teaching their peers. By using both a lecture format and small groups, both direct instruction and cooperative learning will be delivered to students. 

Closure
To wrap up this activity, have students write a reflective statement in their
journals, math logs, or on a loose-leaf piece of paper simply stating any
concepts they have learned or are now clearer after completion of this lesson.
Allow them to also express any questions or areas that may need more attention
given to them as well. As an instructor, collect these reflective statements and
see in which areas your students are confident and in which areas they seemed to
be confused or find difficult. Take these accounts into consideration when
teaching future lessons and revisit any troubled areas before moving on in the
unit.","Willie Nelson",4,"Math"
